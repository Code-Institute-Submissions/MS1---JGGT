                <p class="about-me-text">My obsession with Music began from a young age, 
                I started playing guitar at age 8 and went on to study Music 
                at the highest level at The Institute of Contempory Music Performance in London.
                After my time there I went on to perform across the UK and abroad on
                various gigs, tours and festivals. With all this experience I'm able 
                to teach any level of guitar, whether you might be a complete beginner, 
                a seasoned shred head or somewhere inbetween!</p>

                    I have always found that by tracking students progress, they have a clear
                    way of seeing and measuring where they started and how far they've come. 
                    This is really important especially when students might start to lose focus
                    in why they're studying. By seeing their past progress it can help bolster them 
                    when they hit a steep learning curve and realise that they can push through.

                <div class="results-text">
                    Last but not least, it's crucially important to quantify results to give students a sense 
                    of accomplishment. The feeling when you get finally "get" it, when all the little pieces of 
                    that puzzle finally click into place is hugely rewarding.

            <div class="info-1">This first track is from my band When Our Time Comes' debut self titled album. It's more of a rhythmically 
                challenging song, particularly the bridge section. The bridge starts off with a clean guitar part arpeggiating the 
                chorus chords before kicking into a heavy alternate picked 16th note riff that bounces back and forth between 4/4 
                and 3/4 time every bar. At a tempo of 148bpm it can be a very fatiguing passage for the right hand to play and 
                required a lot of metronome practice to get it sounding tight!

            <div class="info-2">This track is another When Our Time Comes song, this time from our debut EP. This again comes with 
                some more rhythmically challenging aspects with most of the song being in 7/8 time as well as some big chord shapes 
                in the chorus. The solo features some advanced techniques such as two handed tapping and some fast legato runs over 
                more odd time signatures.

                    I was recommended to Jack by a friend of mine who previously had lessons from him, 
                    I had been playing guitar for a few years but was stuck in a rut and wanted to widen my skill set. 
                    After a chat we identified what things I wanted to learn and how I was going to get there. Now 5 months later 
                    and I'm an infinitely better guitarist and free of all my old bad playing habits which at one point I didn't 
                    think was possible! I would highly recommend anyone looking to become a better player to take up lessons with 
                    Jack, you won't regret it! <span> - Dan S.</span>

            <div class="testimonials-text-2"> 
                    Before having lessons with Jack I had never played guitar at all, I had seen his 
                    advertisement on Facebook and decided to take on my new challenge with an experienced guitar tutor. Jacks approach 
                    to beginner guitarists is fantastic, he has a great amount of patience and understanding as he always tells me, 
                    "Even Joe Satriani was a beginner once!". Now 3 years on and I'm able to play songs I could only dream of playing 
                    before, this is only due to the sense of dedication and hard work (read: lots of practice) instilled in me by Jack. 
                    If you're shopping around for your first/new guitar tutor, look no further! <span> - Alex B.</span>

                    I've been playing guitar for a number of years now and I've been having lessons with 
                    Jack for just over a year. I had always been more of a rhythm player and wanted to learn some solo/lead techniques. 
                    Throughout all of the tuition, Jacks' attention to detail really stood out to me. He was conscious of every nuance of 
                    the techniques and solos that he was teaching me and made sure I was aware of the importance of really <em>playing</em>
                    the song and making sure those subtleties came out. On top of this he always made sure that learning was a fun and musical
                    experience and not just running scales constantly. Whatever you're looking to learn, Jack will certainly be able to help 
                    you on your musical journey. <span> - Chris T.</span>
