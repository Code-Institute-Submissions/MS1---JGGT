            <div class="col-8 testimonial">I was recommended to Jack by a friend of mine who previously had lessons from him, 
                    I had been playing guitar for a few years but was stuck in a rut and wanted to widen my skill set. 
                    After a chat we identified what things I wanted to learn and how I was going to get there. Now 5 months later 
                    and I'm an infinitely better guitarist and free of all my old bad playing habits which at one point I didn't 
                    think was possible! I would highly recommend anyone looking to become a better player to take up lessons with 
                    Jack, you won't regret it!
            </div>
            <div class="col-8 testimonial">Before having lessons with Jack I had never played guitar at all, I had seen his 
                advertisement on Facebook and decided to take on my new challenge with an experienced guitar tutor. Jacks approach 
                to beginner guitarists is fantastic, he has a great amount of patience and understanding as he always tells me, 
                "Even Joe Satriani was a beginner once!". Now 3 years on and I'm able to play songs I could only dream of playing 
                before, this is only due to the sense of dedication and hard work (read: lots of practice) instilled in me by Jack. 
                If you're shopping around for your first/new guitar tutor, look no further!
            </div>
            <div class="col-8 testimonial">I've been playing guitar for a number of years now and I've been having lessons with 
                Jack for just over a year. I had always been more of a rhythm player and wanted to learn some solo/lead techniques. 
                Throughout all of the tuition, Jacks' attention to detail really stood out to me. He was conscious of every nuance of 
                the techniques and solos that he was teaching me and made sure I was aware of the importance of really <em>playing</em>
                the song and making sure those subtleties came out. On top of this he always made sure that learning was a fun and musical
                experience and not just running scales constantly. Whatever you're looking to learn, Jack will certainly be able to help 
                you on your musical journey.
